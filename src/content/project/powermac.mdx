## About the project

I recently acquired an old PowerMac G5 tower (still boots!) from a friend of mine. It has a really old version of OS X on it and seems like it was previously used at a school. Initially I thought it may be cool to try to preserve the device but I ultimately decided to build a Windows machine in it.

## The plan

I bought an ATX conversion kit: https://thelaserhive.com/product/g5-atx-kit-psu-holder/

Next steps are to follow the instructions and dremel out part of the back of the case and install the conversion kit. Then the hardest part, getting all the parts for the build.
