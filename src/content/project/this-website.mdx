## About the project

Aside from messing around with the early iterations of Google Sites in my youth, my previous web development projects were all work related and were either small changes to existing resources or WordPress supported builds. This is my first personal web development project that I've completed that began with essentially nothing.

## Shoutouts

Thanks to my good friend Piotr for introducing me to TailwindCSS, teaching me the basics, and passing some of his UI/UX wisdom on to me.
