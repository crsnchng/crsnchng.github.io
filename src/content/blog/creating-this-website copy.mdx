## Game Changer.

Thanks to the instant coffees I've tried recently, I can confidently say that I can make an *exceptional* cup of coffee in less than 60 seconds.

I almost feel bad as I shake up a bottle of instant coffee in front of my [Flair 58](https://flairespresso.com/product/flair-58/) and [Craig Lyn HG-1](https://craiglyn.com/product/hg-1-prime/), but its almost impossible for me to commit to the 10 minute espresso making process in the morning with the existence of these instant coffees. That being said, I do still enjoy the process and freedom of experimentation that comes with espresso when I have time. 

I don't really have much else to say about this; I highly recommend giving them a try. From a consistency, efficiency, and convenience perspective, instant coffee is unmatched. I've heard that its one of the more [environmentally friendly ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-zOtDW4AWI) to make coffee as well. 

Here are the two roasters I've tried (and loved) so far: [Canyon](https://canyoncoffee.co/collections/canyon-instant-coffee) and [Black & White](https://www.blackwhiteroasters.com/collections/specialty-instant-coffee)
